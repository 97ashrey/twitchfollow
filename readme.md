# Twitch Tv Follow App
This is a project for the Free Code Camp assignment. I used ES6 classes to build this one. Sometimes it won't work because the API doesn't respond very well. It was very fun building this because i dwell on twitch often and i was nice to see some of it's data in the background. You can [test the app](http://97ashrey.github.io/twitchfollow/).
